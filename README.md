  Chloe's Portfolio, Gatsby version
</h1>

As I'm learning React, I want to share a new version of my portfolio, homemade with Gatsby ! 

## 🚀 Let's get started

That is my first project using **Gatsby**. I'm a fresh React developer and I wanted to explore *further possibilities* ! I thought Gatsby would be a great solution for my portfolio, as I wanted a **static**, **performant**, **easy to run** and to use website. To sum up, it allows me to focus on the content I share on this portfolio while learning to use a funny framework 🎉

## ⚙️ Process

### What's in there ?

First, I determined the structure of this portfolio. This new version will be composed of : 
- A **homepage** with : 
  - A quick **presentation**
  - A **music** I'd like to share 
- An "**about me**" section
- My **stack** as a web developer
- My **resume**, that you can download (PDF version)
- And *forthcoming*, a **blog** section

Then I decided which **tools** I'll use : 
- Gatsby (of course)
- **Sass**, pure CSS with a dash of magic
- **Fontawesome** for the social media icons
- A few **gatsby plugins**

The `package.json` file reveals all my secrets, if you're curious !

And now I'm working on it ! See you soon 👋
